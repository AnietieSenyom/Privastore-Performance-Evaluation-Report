## ‚úÖ Recommendations

- Strengthen the relationship with Sean Miller and similar high-value clients through loyalty programs or exclusive offerings.  
- Double down on marketing and customized solutions for the Consumer segment to maintain its dominance and increase retention.  
- Allocate more resources and expansion efforts toward the West region to capitalize on its high return, while building competitive strategies for the East and Central regions.  
- Focus R&D and inventory on Technology products, possibly bundling with Office Supplies to leverage cross-category appeal.  
- Maintain Standard Class as the default shipping option, but consider promoting First Class in select high-income markets to improve shipping margins.  
- Analyze what drove the 2014 performance surge and replicate those strategies‚Äîpossibly in pricing, campaigns, or product mix‚Äîfor future years.  
- Concentrate marketing in top-performing states like California and New York while identifying latent demand in lower-performing but populated states like Pennsylvania.  
- Explore ways to grow Corporate and Home Office segments, such as business discounts, B2B services, or customized office solutions.  
- Use category-level insights to drive seasonal promotions‚Äîfor example, focusing on Furniture during back-to-school or office renovation periods.  
- Invest in urban sales infrastructure (pop-up stores, local ads) in cities like NYC and LA while evaluating delivery logistics in mid-tier markets.  
- Offer targeted promotions or VIP benefits to other leading customers like Tamara Chand to nurture them into top-tier spenders.  
- Review premium shipping modes to identify friction points (pricing, delivery speed) and potentially introduce hybrid models.
